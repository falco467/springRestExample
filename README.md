# Spring Boot Data Rest Repository Example

This is an example project to setup a simple rest-repository.
There are some example entities, which can be created, updated
and searched.

## Installation and Startup

This project uses the gradle wrapper "gradlew" to start the
project you only need a JDK (at least 11) in your path and
a working internet connection to load all dependencies from
the maven repositories.
The Gradle Wrapper is tracked by git lfs, please make sure
your git client has lfs support "git lfs install"

    # Startup
    gradlew bootRun

## Accessing the Repository

The Server will by default start on "localhost:8080" and
you can access everything by calling http://localhost:8080/
in your browser. All endpoints are HATEOAS described.

There is a "test.http" file with example calls.

## API Documentation - Swagger

Swagger2 Documentation is automatically generated by Springfox
and can be accessed at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/

## Database Configuration

The project contains the in-memory database H2, which will not
persist to disk for ease of use. Other databases can easily
be attached by creating a springboot.properties configuration
with a new profile and the connection information.
